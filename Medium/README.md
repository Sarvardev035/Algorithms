This folder contains solutions to LeetCode Medium difficulty problems.

## Solutions

| # | Problem | Solution | Topics | Difficulty |
|---|---------|----------|--------|------------|
| 2 | [Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/) | [Python](AddTwoNumbers.py) | Linked List, Math, Recursion | Medium |
| 3 | [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/) | [Python](LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters.py) | Hash Table, String, Sliding Window | Medium |

## Key Concepts

- **Linked Lists**: Understanding pointer manipulation and node traversal
- **Sliding Window**: Efficient technique for substring/subarray problems
- **Hash Maps**: Quick lookups and tracking elements
- **Two Pointers**: Dynamic window sizing
- **Carry Handling**: Important for mathematical operations across nodes

## Tips

- Break down complex problems into smaller steps
- Consider using dummy nodes for linked list problems
- Sliding window is excellent for substring problems
- Always handle edge cases (empty inputs, single elements)
- Draw diagrams to visualize linked list operations
